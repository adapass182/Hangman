# Hangman
## Hangman app built using React/Redux

A simple game of Hangman that utilises a pre-determined library of words to seed a random selection tool! This is my first project working with real game logic, and I had a lot of fun implementing not only the core features but some quality of life improvements at the end too.

You can start a game, try again after finishing, and see a few different messages based on your progress.

Launch this game locally after cloning the repo - just remember to fetch the dependencies, then yarn start and you're good to go.

## TODO:

- Improve design (revisit with material-ui?)
- Add hangman graphics
- Deploy
